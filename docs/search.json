    "text": "This goal measures whether people have the opportunity to fish at a small local scales.\n\n\nArtisanal fishing, often called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation, and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, especially in developing nations. Small-scale fishing is also an important component of cultural identity and heritage.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Artisanal Fishing Opportunities score for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region was 85.\nOverall, these scores are fairly high which indicates demand for artisanal fishing is being met using lawful and sustainable methods, or alternatively, there is little economic need for artisanal fishing (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Israel, Yemen). The lowest scoring regions are Eritrea (high need, fairly low access) and Sudan (high need, small scale fisheries could be better managed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive map below shows the scores for the different countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis goal measures how easily people can access ocean resources when they need them and whether the stocks being harvested are sustainably managed.\nThe model has three components:\n\nNeed: The percent of population below the poverty line. The global OHI model uses per capita GDP as a proxy for need.\nAccess: Institutional permits and regulations encouraging small fisheries and providing access to coastal regions. Data is from the UN sustainable development goal 14.b.1 which measures the degree of application of a legal, regulatory, policy, or institutional framework which recognizes and protects access rights for small-scale fisheries.\nSustainability: Sustainability of fishing methods and/or the health of targeted species. Sustainable gears are traditional hook and line, as opposed to unsustainable practices such as dynamite and gill net fishing. The global assessment uses the same stock status data used to calculate the fisheries subgoal scores.\n\nA high score indicates that the demand for artisanal fishing is being met using lawful and sustainable methods, or alternatively, there is little economic need for artisanal fishing. A low score indicates that regions are not achieving or allowing sustainable artisanal fishing opportunities to be realized.\n\n\n\nThe biggest factor driving scores, by far, is the current status component. Here, we take a closer look at the data underlying the status scores for each country with EEZ territory in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n:::{callout-note collapse=TRUE}\n\n\n\nOHI scores are primarily driven by the current status dimension of the score, but pressures, resilience, and past trends are also important components of the goal score. In most cases, these variables will nudge the score a bit higher or lower than the current status score.\nThere are over 20 pressure variables (e.g., ocean warming, ocean acidification) and about 15 resilience variables (e.g., good governance and high gdp) used in the global assessment.\nEach country gets a score for each pressure and resilience variable. For example, for each country we estimated the intensity of increase in ocean temperature, and rescaled these data to range from 0 to 1 (no pressure vs. highest pressure).\nEach goal is affected by a subset of the pressure and resilience variables.\nWe provide a brief description of all the pressure and resilience variables along with how they affect each goal. A brief description of how these variables are incorporated into the final score is here. :::\n\n\n\n\nAs a proxy for subsistence fishing need, we use the inverse of per capita purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted gross domestic product (GDP), or GDPpcPPP. These data are rescaled to values between 0 and 1 by taking the natural log of the data and dividing all the values by the GDPpcPPP value that corresponds to the 95th quantile across all years (from 2005 to most recent data) and countries.\nSaudi Arabia, Israel, and Yemen have low economic need, whereas, the other countries have relatively high economic mean.\nFor more details see the data preparation script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed: Country data (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese data are from the UN sustainable development goal 14.b.1, “Degree of application of a legal/regulatory/policy/institutional framework which recognizes and protects access rights for small-scale fisheries (level of implementation: 1 lowest to 5 highest)”. We linearly rescale these data to have values between 0 and 1.\nAll Red Sea and Gulf of Aden regions have high access scores from 0.8-1, except Eritrea which is 0.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess to artisanal fisheries: Country data (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is calculated using the same data as the fisheries subgoal, but using only the artisanal catch. For each region, we average the stock status scores weighted by the total catch. The country level catch data (tonnes per year) is from FAO and the B/Bmsy (the biomass of the population relative to the biomass at maximum sustainable yield) are from RAM when available. Otherwise, we use the CMSY approach to estimate B/Bmsy.\nThe scores are relatively high for all the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden regions. They are around 0.8 for for Sudan, Egypt, and Israel; and &gt; 0.9 for the remaining countries.\nFor more information about the methods, check out the scripts used to prepare these data: (preparing catch and estimating score\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainable harvest of artisanal stocks: Country data (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the current model, this goal would be most improved by reducing the economic need for artisanal fishing in Somalia, Sudan, Dijibouti, Eritrea, Jordan, and Egypt. Access to artisanal fishing could also be improved in Eritrea.\nOtherwise, access to artisanal fishing is good and artisanally fished stocks are relatively healthy.\nFuture assessments should carefully assess the underlying data for improvements, here are some factors to consider:\n\nTo determine whether artisanally fished stocks are well managed we use a global database of stock status scores that requires much gapfilling of missing data. However, regional assessments of stock status may be available.\nDo the opportunity scores seem reasonable? Should other factors be incorporated, such as piracy?\nThere are better estimates of poverty than the rescaled per capita GDP used for the global assessment. For example, there may be within country estimates of the portion of population living below the poverty line.\n\nOther OHI+ analyses have revised this goal to better reflect local concerns."

    "text": "Why do an independent assessment?\nOHI+ assessments are conducted by independent groups to measure ocean health in their regions, countries, states, and communities. These assessments can be used by managers to incorporate local information and priorities at the spatial scale where policy and management decisions are made.\nIndependent assessments use the same framework as the global assessment, but can explore the variables influencing ocean health at the smaller scales where policy and management decisions are made. Goal models and targets are created using higher resolution data, indicators, and priorities, which produce scores better reflecting local realities. This enables scientists, managers, policy makers, and the public to better and more holistically understand, track, and communicate the status of local marine ecosystems, and to design strategic management actions to improve overall ocean health.\nAssessments provide an opportunity engage multiple stakeholders in a collaborative process. In our experiences engaging with various countries around the world, the process of conducting the assessment was just as valuable (if not more) than the final results. This is because the assessment process serves as a forum to engage stakeholders from multiple backgrounds (scientific, civil society, government, private sector, NGOs, etc.) to discuss local preferences and priorities, understand the interactions between various activities, and collaboratively establish management targets.\nConducting a local OHI+ assessment is also valuable because it results in a synthesized collection of data and scientific findings."

The risk of species extinction generates great emotional and moral concern for many people. This concern is demonstrated by the large sums of money that people donate to help conserve species and habitats.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Biodiversity score for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region was 79.\nThis region has reasonably good Biodiversity scores. Egypt has the lowest score of 73, and the other countries score 80 or higher. The scores for the Habitat subgoal tend to be lower than the Species subgoal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive map below shows the scores for the different countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Global OHI, this goal assesses the conservation status of species based on two subgoals: Species and habitat condition. Species are assessed because they are what one typically thinks of in relation to biodiversity. We also assess Habitats because only a small proportion of marine species worldwide have been mapped and assessed, so we consider habitats a proxy for the condition of the broad suite of species that depend on them.\nWe calculate each of these subgoals separately and average them to estimate the overall goal score. A score of 100 means all species are at very low risk of extinction and all habitats are conserved.\nThe subgoal scores can be viewed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubgoal scores (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Species subgoal score for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region was 81.\nMost regions score around 80 or higher, but Israel has the lowest score (63) and Egypt has a relatively low score (73).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive map below shows the scores for the different countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Habitat subgoal score for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region was 77.\nThe Habitat subgoal is lower for nearly all countries than the Species subgoal.

The presence of species that are not at risk leads to a higher score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies calculation details (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies status was calculated as the area weighted average of the conservation status of the assessed species within each region. Marine species distribution and threat category data mostly came from IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and we limited data to all species having IUCN habitat system of “marine” http://www.iucnredlist.org [@iucn2022; @iucn_spatial_2022]. Seabird distributions data came from Birdlife International http://datazone.birdlife.org [@birdlifeinternationalandhandbookofthebirdsoftheworld2020].\nWe scaled the lower end of the biodiversity goal to be 0 when 75% species are extinct, a level comparable to the five documented mass extinctions [@barnosky_has_2011] and would constitute a catastrophic loss of biodiversity.\nThreat weights, \\(w_{i}\\), were assigned based on the IUCN threat categories status of each \\(i\\) species, following the weighting schemes developed by Butchart et al. [-@butchart2007improvements]. For the purposes of this analysis, we included only data for extant species for which sufficient data were available to conduct an assessment. We did not include the Data Deficient classification as assessed species following previously published guidelines for a mid-point approach [@schipper2008status; @hoffmann_impact_2010].\nWe first calculated each the region’s area-weighted average species risk status, \\(\\bar R_{spp}\\). For each 0.5 degree grid cell within a region, \\(c\\), the risk status, \\(w\\), for each species, \\(i\\), present is summed and multiplied by cell area \\(A_c\\), to get an area- and count-weighted species risk for each cell. This value is then divided by the sum of count-weighted area \\(A_c \\times N_c\\) across all cells within the region. The result is the area-weighted mean species risk across the entire region.\n\\[\n\\bar R_{spp} = \\frac { \\displaystyle\\sum_{ c=1 }^{ M } \\left( \\displaystyle\\sum _{ i=1 }^{N_c} w_i \\right) \\times A_c }\n                { \\displaystyle\\sum_{ c=1 }^{ M } A_c \\times N_c },  (Eq. 6.4)\n\\] To convert \\(\\bar R_{spp}\\) into a score, we set a floor at 25% (representing a catastrophic loss of biodiversity, as noted above) and then rescaled to produce a \\(x_{spp}\\) value between zero and one.\n\\[\nx_{spp} = max \\left( \\frac { \\bar R_{SPP} - .25 }{ .75 }, 0 \\right), (Eq. 6.5)\n\\]\nWeights for assessment of species status based on IUCN risk categories\n\n\n\nRisk Category\nIUCN code\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nExtinct\nEX\n0.0\n\n\nCritically Endangered\nCR\n0.2\n\n\nEndangered\nEN\n0.4\n\n\nVulnerable\nVU\n0.6\n\n\nNear Threatened\nNT\n0.8\n\n\nLeast Concern\nLC\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe habitat component of the Biodiversity goal measures the status of marine habitats that support large numbers of marine species.\nHealthier habitats mean healthier species! Habitat is included as a subgoal of the Biodiversity goal to provide a more complete picture of diversity in the system than only considering the conservation status of species (the other subgoal for Biodiversity). This is because species assessments are often incomplete.\nThis goal assesses the condition of marine habitats that are particularly important in supporting large numbers of marine species. The status of each habitat is its current condition relative to its reference condition, which is often based on historical area. A score of 1 indicates that the condition equals or exceeds the reference point. The subgoal score is then calculated by combining the habitat scores for each region.\nFor the global OHI assessment, we included mangroves, coral reefs, kelp forests, seagrass beds, salt marshes, sea ice, or subtidal soft-bottom habitats. All habitats measured contribute equally to the score, regardless of their extent, because the presence of a diverse set of habitats, as well as the level of conservation of each, is considered valuable to achieve this goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about global habitats (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabitat\nCondition\nExtent\nTrend\n\n\n\n\nSeagrass\nIncreasing or stable trend assigned condition = 1.0; decreasing trend assigned condition = 0.71 based on global loss\nSeagrass extent per oceanic region (vector based)\nCalculated across data from 1990 - 2000\n\n\nKelp\nIncreasing or stable trend assigned condition = 1.0; decreasing trend assigned condition based on a 2% global yearly loss\nKelp extent per oceanic region (vector based)\nCalculated across data from 1983 - 2012\n\n\nCoral reefs\nCurrent % cover divided by reference % cover\nCoral reef extent per oceanic region (Vector based)\nCalculated across data from 1975-2006\n\n\nMangroves\nCurrent hectares divided by reference hectares, for coastal mangroves only\nMangrove extent per oceanic region (vector based)\nCalculated using 5 most recent years of data\n\n\nSalt marsh\nAll regions assigned condition = 0.75 based on conservative historical extent losses\nSalt marsh extent per oceanic region\nAll regions assigned trend based on historical .28% global yearly loss\n\n\nSea ice edge\nCurrent (3-year rolling-average using the current year and previous 2 years) % cover of sea ice having 10-50% cover, divided by reference % cover average from 1979-2000\nSame as condition\nCalculated from the fitted slope of %-deviation-from-reference per year, of the most recent 5 years of data (each year of data is based on 3-year average)\n\n\nSoft bottom\nSoft-bottom destructive fishing practices relative to area of soft-bottom habitat and rescaled to 0-1 based on relative global values\nHalpern et al.

Habitat health is evaluated on a scale from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating the current condition is at, or better, than the reference point; trend is the average yearly change in health during the most recent 5 years; and extent is not used in the model, but is the estimated area of the habitat in each region in km2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabitat data: Country data (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the current model, this goal would be most improved by:\n\nreducing reliance on fishing practices that are destructive to marine soft-bottom habitats, such as dredging, particularly in Saudi Arabia\nrestoring and protecting mangrove habitat\n\nFuture assessments should evaluate whether better data is available, particularly habitat data. Most often, countries have access to better habitat data than what we use at the global scale. This goal is driven by how the habitat has changed relative to some historic period, either in extent or condition. Finding data describing how habitats have changed over time is particularly difficult at the global scale, and regional data or expert opinion can provide a more accurate assessment of habitat condition.\nFurthermore, future assessments should consider whether all relevant habitats are included in the model.\nFor the Species subgoal, we have found that pairing IUCN data with local expert opinion to be helpful in fine-tuning these scores.\nOther OHI+ analyses have revised the habitat and species subgoals to better reflect local concerns."

The presence of species that are not at risk leads to a higher score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies calculation details (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies status was calculated as the area weighted average of the conservation status of the assessed species within each region. Marine species distribution and threat category data mostly came from IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and we limited data to all species having IUCN habitat system of “marine” http://www.iucnredlist.org [@iucn2022; @iucn_spatial_2022]. Seabird distributions data came from Birdlife International http://datazone.birdlife.org [@birdlifeinternationalandhandbookofthebirdsoftheworld2020].\nWe scaled the lower end of the biodiversity goal to be 0 when 75% species are extinct, a level comparable to the five documented mass extinctions [@barnosky_has_2011] and would constitute a catastrophic loss of biodiversity.\nThreat weights, \\(w_{i}\\), were assigned based on the IUCN threat categories status of each \\(i\\) species, following the weighting schemes developed by Butchart et al. [-@butchart2007improvements]. For the purposes of this analysis, we included only data for extant species for which sufficient data were available to conduct an assessment. We did not include the Data Deficient classification as assessed species following previously published guidelines for a mid-point approach [@schipper2008status; @hoffmann_impact_2010].\nWe first calculated each the region’s area-weighted average species risk status, \\(\\bar R_{spp}\\). For each 0.5 degree grid cell within a region, \\(c\\), the risk status, \\(w\\), for each species, \\(i\\), present is summed and multiplied by cell area \\(A_c\\), to get an area- and count-weighted species risk for each cell. This value is then divided by the sum of count-weighted area \\(A_c \\times N_c\\) across all cells within the region. The result is the area-weighted mean species risk across the entire region.\n\\[\n\\bar R_{spp} = \\frac { \\displaystyle\\sum_{ c=1 }^{ M } \\left( \\displaystyle\\sum _{ i=1 }^{N_c} w_i \\right) \\times A_c }\n                { \\displaystyle\\sum_{ c=1 }^{ M } A_c \\times N_c },  (Eq. 6.4)\n\\] To convert \\(\\bar R_{spp}\\) into a score, we set a floor at 25% (representing a catastrophic loss of biodiversity, as noted above) and then rescaled to produce a \\(x_{spp}\\) value between zero and one.\n\\[\nx_{spp} = max \\left( \\frac { \\bar R_{SPP} - .25 }{ .75 }, 0 \\right), (Eq. 6.5)\n\\]\nWeights for assessment of species status based on IUCN risk categories\n\n\n\nRisk Category\nIUCN code\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nExtinct\nEX\n0.0\n\n\nCritically Endangered\nCR\n0.2\n\n\nEndangered\nEN\n0.4\n\n\nVulnerable\nVU\n0.6\n\n\nNear Threatened\nNT\n0.8\n\n\nLeast Concern\nLC\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe habitat component of the Biodiversity goal measures the status of marine habitats that support large numbers of marine species.\nHealthier habitats mean healthier species! Habitat is included as a subgoal of the Biodiversity goal to provide a more complete picture of diversity in the system than only considering the conservation status of species (the other subgoal for Biodiversity). This is because species assessments are often incomplete.\nThis goal assesses the condition of marine habitats that are particularly important in supporting large numbers of marine species. The status of each habitat is its current condition relative to its reference condition, which is often based on historical area. A score of 1 indicates that the condition equals or exceeds the reference point. The subgoal score is then calculated by combining the habitat scores for each region.\nFor the global OHI assessment, we included mangroves, coral reefs, kelp forests, seagrass beds, salt marshes, sea ice, or subtidal soft-bottom habitats. All habitats measured contribute equally to the score, regardless of their extent, because the presence of a diverse set of habitats, as well as the level of conservation of each, is considered valuable to achieve this goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about global habitats (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabitat\nCondition\nExtent\nTrend\n\n\n\n\nSeagrass\nIncreasing or stable trend assigned condition = 1.0; decreasing trend assigned condition = 0.71 based on global loss\nSeagrass extent per oceanic region (vector based)\nCalculated across data from 1990 - 2000\n\n\nKelp\nIncreasing or stable trend assigned condition = 1.0; decreasing trend assigned condition based on a 2% global yearly loss\nKelp extent per oceanic region (vector based)\nCalculated across data from 1983 - 2012\n\n\nCoral reefs\nCurrent % cover divided by reference % cover\nCoral reef extent per oceanic region (Vector based)\nCalculated across data from 1975-2006\n\n\nMangroves\nCurrent hectares divided by reference hectares, for coastal mangroves only\nMangrove extent per oceanic region (vector based)\nCalculated using 5 most recent years of data\n\n\nSalt marsh\nAll regions assigned condition = 0.75 based on conservative historical extent losses\nSalt marsh extent per oceanic region\nAll regions assigned trend based on historical .28% global yearly loss\n\n\nSea ice edge\nCurrent (3-year rolling-average using the current year and previous 2 years) % cover of sea ice having 10-50% cover, divided by reference % cover average from 1979-2000\nSame as condition\nCalculated from the fitted slope of %-deviation-from-reference per year, of the most recent 5 years of data (each year of data is based on 3-year average)\n\n\nSoft bottom\nSoft-bottom destructive fishing practices relative to area of soft-bottom habitat and rescaled to 0-1 based on relative global values\nHalpern et al.

For the global assessment, the contribution of these two subgoals to the overall score is weighted by their total seafood yield. However, other approaches for weighting the contribution of these subgoals are reasonable.\nA high score indicates that a region has maximized the amount of sustainably produced seafood from wild or ocean-cultured stocks. For fisheries, both over- and under- harvesting should be penalized. For mariculture, production should be at the sustainable “potential”.\n\n\nAs humanity’s population continues to expand, we must increasingly rely upon new and improved methods for cultivating food on land and in the ocean. The term aquaculture refers to the cultivation in water (fresh and saltwater) of animals or plants for human consumption. Mariculture refers to the commercial harvest of seafood that is farm-raised in the ocean and along the coast.\nAquaculture is the fastest growing animal food production sector in the world, with a 527% rise in production from 1990 to 2018 (FAO 2020)! As the population contines to grow, it will become increasingly important to efficiently grow food using sustainable mariculture practices.\nMariculture scores are based on two factors:\n\nMaximizing the amount of seafood that can grown based on conditions.\nEnsuring that mariculture practices are sustainable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore details (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe status of the mariculture subgoal, \\(x_{mar}\\), was calculated using three sources of data:\n\nMariculture production: Tonnes of production for both marine and brackish waters, excluding species that were not used as a source of food for human consumption is from FAO.\nPotential production: Gentry et al. (2019) estimates the tonnes of possible production for marine aquaculture at a high resolution spatial scale. To account for social and economic realities and other constraints to these ecological potentials, we constrained the per-country potential to 1% of this tonnage estimate and used these country values as reference points.\nSustainability: Additionally, we include a sustainability score for each species in each region which is based on the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch aquaculture recommendations [@2023].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wild-caught fisheries subgoal evaluates how well we maximize harvest without damaging the ocean’s ability to continue providing fish for people in the future. The sustainable harvest of wild-caught seafood avoids excessively high exploitation of target species and does not target threatened populations. Each year’s catch must not take so much from the population that future catches will decline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore details (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe assess food provision from wild caught fisheries by estimating population biomass relative to the biomass that can deliver maximum sustainable yield (\\(B/B_{MSY}\\)) for each stock. When available, we obtained \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values from the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database.\nWhen RAM data were not available, we used data-limited approaches that have been developed to estimate \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values using globally available catch data.\nTo calculate the status for each region and year, \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values were converted to a stock status score between 0-1 that penalizes over-harvesting. To obtain the overall status for each region, the stock status scores for all the stocks within a region were averaged using a geometric mean weighted by the average catch (tonnes) of each stock using Sea Around Us catch data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest factor driving scores, by far, is the current status component. Here, we take a closer look at the data underlying the status scores for each country with EEZ territory in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n:::{callout-note collapse=TRUE}\n\n\n\nOHI scores are primarily driven by the current status dimension of the score, but pressures, resilience, and past trends are also important components of the goal score.

Sustainability is rescaled to values between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating perfect sustainable.\nThe sustainability scores for reared seafood are fairly high for all countries and taxa, with the exception of Egypt. Egypt has low sustainability for European seabass, Gilthead seabream, and Meagre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMariculture sustainability: Country data (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine whether the farming of seafood is maximized relative to potential we determined the tonnes of production relative to the tonnes of production that is possible based on environmental conditions.\nGiven the potential, there is very little farming of seafood throughout the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMariculture sustainability: Country data (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wildcaught fisheries score is based on how well fisheries are managed. We use B/Bmsy values to assess how stocks are managed. This table describes recorded fisheries catch with corresponding stock status scores (i.e., bbmsy). B/Bmsy scores of 1, or greater, indicate the stock is healthy and current biomass is at, or above, maximum sustainable yield.\nIn this case, many stock throughout the region lack assessments, indicating that fisheries could be better managed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFisheries status and catch: Country data (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, both mariculture and fisheries scores are low for all the countries in this region.\nBased on these data, mariculture scores are very low primarily because production is low compared to the potential for production. About 226,000 tonnes of seafood are farmed each year in this region, with Egypt producing the most (~138,00 tonnes) and Saudi Arabia next (~85,000). However, this is small relative to the 3.7 million tonnes that could, theoretically, be produced.\nThe sustainability scores for reared seafood are fairly high for all countries and taxa, with the exception of Egypt. Egypt has low sustainability for European seabass, Gilthead seabream, and Meagre, which have, relatively, high production.\nFisheries scores are low primarily because most of the wild-caught fish from this region do not have stock stack scores, which we use as an indicator of weak fisheries management for the global assessment. Only about 40% of the fish catch is identified to species, which means that it can not be assessed using stock assessments and this is heavily penalized in the global Ocean Health Index fisheries model.\nFuture assessments should carefully assess the underlying data and models to meet their objectives.\nOther OHI+ analyses have revised mariculture and fisheries subgoals to better reflect local concerns."

As the population contines to grow, it will become increasingly important to efficiently grow food using sustainable mariculture practices.\nMariculture scores are based on two factors:\n\nMaximizing the amount of seafood that can grown based on conditions.\nEnsuring that mariculture practices are sustainable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore details (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe status of the mariculture subgoal, \\(x_{mar}\\), was calculated using three sources of data:\n\nMariculture production: Tonnes of production for both marine and brackish waters, excluding species that were not used as a source of food for human consumption is from FAO.\nPotential production: Gentry et al. (2019) estimates the tonnes of possible production for marine aquaculture at a high resolution spatial scale. To account for social and economic realities and other constraints to these ecological potentials, we constrained the per-country potential to 1% of this tonnage estimate and used these country values as reference points.\nSustainability: Additionally, we include a sustainability score for each species in each region which is based on the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch aquaculture recommendations [@2023].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wild-caught fisheries subgoal evaluates how well we maximize harvest without damaging the ocean’s ability to continue providing fish for people in the future. The sustainable harvest of wild-caught seafood avoids excessively high exploitation of target species and does not target threatened populations. Each year’s catch must not take so much from the population that future catches will decline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore details (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe assess food provision from wild caught fisheries by estimating population biomass relative to the biomass that can deliver maximum sustainable yield (\\(B/B_{MSY}\\)) for each stock. When available, we obtained \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values from the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database.\nWhen RAM data were not available, we used data-limited approaches that have been developed to estimate \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values using globally available catch data.\nTo calculate the status for each region and year, \\(B/B_{MSY}\\) values were converted to a stock status score between 0-1 that penalizes over-harvesting. To obtain the overall status for each region, the stock status scores for all the stocks within a region were averaged using a geometric mean weighted by the average catch (tonnes) of each stock using Sea Around Us catch data."

However, in cases where a subcomponent was zero, we added a value of 0.01 (on a scale of 0 to 1) to prevent the overall score from going to zero. Given that there is uncertainty around our pollution estimates, a zero score resulting from one subcomponent seemed too extreme.\nAlthough clean waters are relevant and important anywhere in the ocean, coastal waters drive this goal both because the problems of pollution are concentrated there and because people predominantly access and care about clean waters in coastal areas.

Furthermore, the data for high seas areas is limited and there is little meaningful regulation or governance over the input of pollution into these areas.

For example, for each country we estimated the intensity of increase in ocean temperature, and rescaled these data to range from 0 to 1 (no pressure vs. highest pressure).\nEach goal is affected by a subset of the pressure and resilience variables.\nWe provide a brief description of all the pressure and resilience variables along with how they affect each goal. A brief description of how these variables are incorporated into the final score is here. :::\n\n\n\n\nThe status of this goal is based on 4 types of pollution: nutrient, chemical, pathogen, and plastic trash.

This might be improved by improvements to trash disposal on land.\nFor future assessments, the quality of data should be assessed. This is particularly the case for the plastic pollution data set which is a global dataset derived from point source samples. We should evaluate the quality of the data in the Red Sea region."

Regional applications of the Index can make use of better-resolved data and more direct measures of tourism, as has been done within the US West Coast, where data for participation in coastal recreational activities across 19 different sectors were available.\nMeasures of sustainability are data from the World Economic Forum’s Travel & Tourism Development Index (TTDI).

However, some (unknown) proportion of business travelers also enjoy the coast for leisure during their visit to coastal areas, such that we assumed all tourist arrivals were related to tourism and recreation values. Regional applications of the Index can make use of better-resolved data and more direct measures of tourism, as has been done within the US West Coast, where data for participation in coastal recreational activities across 19 different sectors were available.\nMeasures of sustainability are data from the World Economic Forum’s Travel & Tourism Development Index (TTDI). This index measures “the set of factors and policies that enable the sustainable and resilient development of the Travel and Tourism (T&T) sector, which in turn contributes to the development of a country.” The index is comprised of five subindexes 17 pillars and 112 individual indicators, distributed among the different pillars. We use scores for the Travel and Tourism Sustainability Subindex which encompasses three pillars:\nPillar 15: Environmental Sustainability\n\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita\nRenewable energy\nGlobal Climate Risk Index\nInvestment in green energy and infrastructure\nParticulate matter (2.5) concentration\nBaseline water stress\nRed List Index\nForest cover loss\nWastewater treatment\nClean ocean water\nNumber of environmental treaty ratifications\nAdequate protection for nature\nOversight of production impact on the environment and nature\nTotal protected areas coverage\nAverage proportion of key bio\n\nPillar 16: Socioeconomic Resilience and Conditions\n\nPoverty rate\nSocial protection basic coverage\nSocial protection spending\nNot in education, employment or training (NEET) ratio\nEqual workforce opportunities\nWorkers’ rights\nGender Inequality Index\n\nPillar 17: Travel and Tourism Demand Pressure and Impact\n\nT&T GDP multiplier\nInbound length of stay\nSeasonality of international tourist arrivals\nConcentration of interest in cultural attractions\nConcentration of interest in nature attractions\nGeographically dispersed tourism\nQuality of town and city centre\n\nThe sustainability factor, \\(S\\), is the Travel and Tourism Sustainability Subindex score, which is the unweighted average of its three component pillars."

For example, millions of marine ornamental (aquarium) fish are harvested and exported for sale each year. This trade can provide a valuable and long-term income stream for low-income coastal communities if undertaken in a sustainable manner.\nFor the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region, this score is driven almost entirely by the fish oil/fish meal trade. The one exception is that ornamental fish trade comprises about 18% of Israel’s Natural Product score, the rest of the countries have very little (i.e., &lt; 1% of score) or no ornamental fish trade.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Natural Products score for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region was 88.\nThe scores in this region are fairly high. There are no data for Sudan and Djbouti.

This goal does not include bioprospecting which focuses on potential (and largely unknowable and potentially infinite) value rather than current realized value, or non-living products such as oil and gas or mining products which by definition are not sustainable. Ideally targets are based on the amount of harvest that does not threaten future harvest, such as the maximum sustainable yield from fisheries stock status scores.\nCurrently, the global Ocean Health Index includes harvest and production of non-food seaweed, ornamental fish, and wild-caught fish used for fish oil and meal.\nA high score indicates that natural resources are maximally harvested at a rate that does not threaten future harvest and minimizes ecological harm.\n\n\n\nThe biggest factor driving scores, by far, is the current status component. Here, we take a closer look at the data underlying the status scores for each country with EEZ territory in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n:::{callout-note collapse=TRUE}\n\n\n\nOHI scores are primarily driven by the current status dimension of the score, but pressures, resilience, and past trends are also important components of the goal score. In most cases, these variables will nudge the score a bit higher or lower than the current status score.\nThere are over 20 pressure variables (e.g., ocean warming, ocean acidification) and about 15 resilience variables (e.g., good governance and high gdp) used in the global assessment.\nEach country gets a score for each pressure and resilience variable. For example, for each country we estimated the intensity of increase in ocean temperature, and rescaled these data to range from 0 to 1 (no pressure vs. highest pressure).\nEach goal is affected by a subset of the pressure and resilience variables.\nWe provide a brief description of all the pressure and resilience variables along with how they affect each goal. A brief description of how these variables are incorporated into the final score is here. :::\n\n\nFor this region, fishoil and fishmeal drives the Natural products score. The one exception is that Israel collects ornamental fish for the aquarium trade, and this comprises about 18% of its score. No seaweed is grown for non-food purposes in any of the regions.\n\n\nWe focus on fish oil and meal because there is no seaweed production and the only producer of aquarium ornamentals is Israel.\nScores reflect the sustainability of marine fisheries for the species used for the production of fish oil and fish meal. The scores are scaled to values between 0 and 1, with one indicating that the stocks are managed sustainably. The model is similar to the fisheries subgoal model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainability of fish oil / fish meal harvest (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis score is primarily driven by the harvest of fish for fish oil and fish meal products, which are primarily used for animal feed (land and marine farming). The fish oil/fish meal component of the score is calculated using a model similar to that used for the marine fisheries subgoal. In this case, the model only includes fish used to produce fish oil and meal. The scores for this goal are reasonably good, with room for improvement, for most of these regions (&gt; 0.8), but Egypt’s score is a bit low (score = 0.75)\nFor Israel, nearly 20% of the score is based on the harvest of ornamental fish for the aquarium trade. According to our limited data, the risk to these species in this region is low.\nFuture assessments should consider: - Are there other natural products harvested from the region that are currently not accounted for? - Do better data exist?\nOther OHI+ analyses have revised this goal to better reflect local concerns."

Additional culturally important species species, available at the continent level (Garcia et al. 2023), were added to supplement the original iconic species list.\n\n\n\nThe Lasting special places sub-goal measures how well we are protecting, for current and future generations, the locations that contribute to marine-related cultural identity.\nSpecial places are coastal and marine areas that are culturally significant for a variety of reasons. Designating a place to be a landmark, monument, and/or Marine Protected Area can help ensure its existence, provide valuable ecosystem services and preserve cultural heritage and identity.\nTo get a score of 100 a region must protect at least 30% of its coastal area.\nWe use the United Nation’s World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) to identify protected areas. The WDPA aggregates several key databases: IUCN’s World Commission on Protected Areas, Global Marine Protected Areas, UNESCO World Heritage Marine sites, National Parks and Nature Reserves, and the United Nations List of Protected Places. In most cases the year of designation is listed for each protected area.\nWe focus only on coastal waters (within 3 nautical miles of shore) for marine special places because we assume lasting special places are primarily in coastal areas.

Ideally one would survey every community around the world to determine the top list of special places, and then assess how those locations are faring relative to a desired state (e.g., protected or well managed). The reality is that such lists do not exist. Instead, we assume areas that are protected indicate special places (i.e., the effort to protect them suggests they are important places). Clearly this is an imperfect assumption but in many cases it will be true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest factor driving scores, by far, is the current status component.

Iconic species include animals such as the Blue Whale (endangered), Grey Reef Shark (endangered), Blacktip Reef Shark (vulnerable), and the Humphead Wrasse (endangered).\nWe identified 24 iconic species within the region. For each species we determine the IUCN threatened status designations within each region the species is located.

People value community identity, tax revenue, and indirect economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy. This goal tracks the number and quality of jobs and the amount of revenue produced across as many marine-related industries/sectors as possible through two sub-goals, Livelihoods and Economies. A score of 100 reflects productive coastal economies that avoid the loss of ocean-dependent livelihoods while maximizing livelihood quality.\n\n\nPeople rely on the ocean to provide livelihoods (i.e., jobs with steady wages) and stable economies for coastal communities. The jobs produced from marine-related industries directly benefit those who are employed, but also have substantial indirect importance to many others.\nIdeally, this sub-goal describes the quality and quantity as well as the sustainability of marine jobs in a coastal community. The jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries directly benefit those who are employed, and also those who gain indirect value from related economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy, such as community identity and tax revenue.\n\n\n\nThe Economies goal captures the economic value associated with marine industries using revenue from marine sectors, such as commercial fishing, mariculture, tourism and recreation, shipping and transportation, whale watching, ports and harbors, ship and boat building, and renewable energy production.\n\n\n\n\nThese data have not been updated at the global scale for over 10 years due to data limitations.\n\n\n\nAlthough this goal is not currently assessed at the global scale, it is probable that data exists for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Countries.\nThe first step of assessing this goal is to identify as many marine-related sectors as possible.\nAfter you have identified the sectors in each area, you will need some measure of their direct and indirect benefits. Direct benefits of jobs include the number of jobs in each area, and the wages or income for such jobs. You could find such information from you local national statistical office, or economics bureaus, for example. Indirect benefits of these jobs to the local communities are calculated through the use of economic multipliers, that can be used to more broadly estimate the revenue generated by marine sector jobs. It’s encouraged to use economic multipliers from the literature.\nThe Livelihoods subgoal ideally includes two equally important sub-components, the number of jobs and the quality of the jobs. Economies is typically composed of a single component, revenue.\nThe final step is determining the reference point. A common reference point for this sub-goal is a temporal one that compares current livelihoods to past livelihoods in the same region. In this case, the goal is to maintain the quantity and quality of marine-related jobs year after year. Another approach would be to use a locally established target for growth.\nGuidance for the livelihoods and economies subgoals should be considered while developing this goal for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden."

This goal tracks the number and quality of jobs and the amount of revenue produced across as many marine-related industries/sectors as possible through two sub-goals, Livelihoods and Economies. A score of 100 reflects productive coastal economies that avoid the loss of ocean-dependent livelihoods while maximizing livelihood quality.\n\n\nPeople rely on the ocean to provide livelihoods (i.e., jobs with steady wages) and stable economies for coastal communities. The jobs produced from marine-related industries directly benefit those who are employed, but also have substantial indirect importance to many others.\nIdeally, this sub-goal describes the quality and quantity as well as the sustainability of marine jobs in a coastal community. The jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries directly benefit those who are employed, and also those who gain indirect value from related economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy, such as community identity and tax revenue.\n\n\n\nThe Economies goal captures the economic value associated with marine industries using revenue from marine sectors, such as commercial fishing, mariculture, tourism and recreation, shipping and transportation, whale watching, ports and harbors, ship and boat building, and renewable energy production."

Direct benefits of jobs include the number of jobs in each area, and the wages or income for such jobs. You could find such information from you local national statistical office, or economics bureaus, for example. Indirect benefits of these jobs to the local communities are calculated through the use of economic multipliers, that can be used to more broadly estimate the revenue generated by marine sector jobs. It’s encouraged to use economic multipliers from the literature.\nThe Livelihoods subgoal ideally includes two equally important sub-components, the number of jobs and the quality of the jobs. Economies is typically composed of a single component, revenue.\nThe final step is determining the reference point. A common reference point for this sub-goal is a temporal one that compares current livelihoods to past livelihoods in the same region. In this case, the goal is to maintain the quantity and quality of marine-related jobs year after year.

For example, the reference point for the global assessment is based on how well a country is doing relative to all the other coastal countries in the world. This is reasonable for a global assessment, but probably isn’t relevant to a specific country.\nOther OHI+ analyses have revised this goal to better reflect local concerns."

    "text": "Why OHI?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Ocean Health Index focuses on what people actually care about, such as jobs and food!\n\n\nMany indices of ocean health focus on abstract stressor variables, such as phosphate levels, sedimentation, pH, etc. Individual indicators are very important, but they provide limited information when it comes to evaluating how well an overall ecosystem is functioning. Plus, they can be difficult to communicate because most people do not directly care about nutrient pollution, however, they do care about its effects on the ocean’s ability to provide recreation and food.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe OHI recognizes people are an important part of the marine system.\n\n\nThe OHI tracks both the pressures we put on oceans as well as the benefits we receive. Both conservation and extractive use of ocean resources are valued, and consequently, scores are highest when we maximize the benefits we receive while maintaining sustainability. Many indices focus only on the pressures that humans apply to systems, which makes sense because we want to be sure to adequately protect the ocean. However, eliminating all pressures on the ocean would require eliminating all contact between humans and the ocean. Beyond being unrealistic, this is undesirable because we would stop receiving all the benefits that we rely on from the ocean."
