Using data from the global 2023 Ocean Health Index analysis, the overall score for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region was `r score`.

The overall Index score is the average of all the regions that have EEZ territories in the [Red Sea and Gulf of Aden](https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/region.html). The contribution of each country is weighted by the area of their EEZ.  

The interactive map below shows how different countries contributed to this score.

## Goal Scores

The Index score is the average of 10 goals that describe how humans value and rely on marine systems.

## More about goals (click to expand)

Clicking on the goal will link to the goal pages which provide more information about goals.
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

goals_df  <- read_csv(here("_data/output/goals.csv")) 
goals_df$subgoal <- sapply(goals_df$subgoal, function(x) 
  if (!is.na(x)) paste0(strrep('&nbsp;', 4), x) else x)

  datatable(goals_df, escape=FALSE, rownames=FALSE)
```

To learn even more: Navigate through the menu at the right for more information about each goal and to view the underlying data used to calculate the goal scores. 

A description of how goal scores are calculated is [located here](https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/OHI.html).

:::{.callout-tip}
## Regional models will produce more relevant OHI scores!

A regional assessment can be better for several reasons: 

- Higher quality local data is often available!

- Goal models, and reference points, can be adapted to better capture the values and concerns of the region.  

- Goals can be weighted differently based on regional priorities.
