**The Ocean Health Index measures ocean health so humans may continue to benefit from healthy marine environments.**

Here we report Ocean Health Index scores for the [Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region](https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/region.html) using data extracted from the [2023 global assessment](https://oceanhealthindex.org). A quick overview of OHI can be found [here](https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/OHI.html). 

## Index score

**The overall Index score for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region was `r score`.**
<br>

<span style="color: gray;">This score is the average of the 2023 OHI global scores for all countries with EEZ territories in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The average is weighted using the size of each country's EEZ.</span>

## Goal Scores

The Index score is the average of 10 goals that describe how humans value and rely on marine systems.

The Flower plot provides the goal scores for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region. The center value is the overall Index score, and the petals describe the score for each goal.

## More about goals (click to expand)

Clicking on the goal will link to the goal pages which provide more information about goals.
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

goals_df  <- read_csv(here("_data/output/goals.csv")) 
goals_df$subgoal <- sapply(goals_df$subgoal, function(x) 
  if (!is.na(x)) paste0(strrep('&nbsp;', 4), x) else x)

  datatable(goals_df, escape=FALSE, rownames=FALSE)
```

To learn more: Navigate the menu at the left for more information about each goal and to view the underlying data used to calculate the goal scores. 

A description of how goal scores are calculated is [located here](https://ohi-rsga.github.io/OHI_RSGA/chapters/OHI.html).

:::{.callout-tip}
## Regional models will produce more relevant OHI scores!

A regional assessment can be better for several reasons: 

- Higher quality local data is often available!

- Goal models, and reference points, can be adapted to better capture the values and concerns of the region.  

- Goals can be weighted differently based on regional priorities.
