The Index score is the average of 10 goals that describe all the ways human value and rely on marine systems. 

The Flower plot provides the overall score for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region for each goal. The center value is the overall Index score.

## Regional models will produce more relevant OHI scores!

This score is the EEZ weighted average score from the OHI global assessment. A regional assessment can be better for several reasons: 

- the global analysis requires using data the most complete global data, however,  local data may be available that is better!

- the goal models can be adapted to better capture the values and concerns of the region. 

- the goals can be weighted differently, and can even be changed.
