    "text": "Why do an independent assessment?\nOHI+ assessments are conducted by independent groups to measure ocean health in their regions, countries, states, and communities. These assessments can be used by managers to incorporate local information and priorities at the spatial scale where policy and management decisions are made.\nIndependent assessments use the same framework as the global assessment, but can explore the variables influencing ocean health at the smaller scales where policy and management decisions are made. Goal models and targets are created using higher resolution data, indicators, and priorities, which produce scores better reflecting local realities. This enables scientists, managers, policy makers, and the public to better and more holistically understand, track, and communicate the status of local marine ecosystems, and to design strategic management actions to improve overall ocean health.\nAssessments provide an opportunity engage multiple stakeholders in a collaborative process. In our experiences engaging with various countries around the world, the process of conducting the assessment was just as valuable (if not more) than the final results. This is because the assessment process serves as a forum to engage stakeholders from multiple backgrounds (scientific, civil society, government, private sector, NGOs, etc.) to discuss local preferences and priorities, understand the interactions between various activities, and collaboratively establish management targets.\nConducting a local OHI+ assessment is also valuable because it results in a synthesized collection of data, scientific findings, and management efforts."
