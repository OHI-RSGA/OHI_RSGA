My first attempt at breaking down the scores, this was for AO. 

This plot shows how the different components, or dimensions, of the goal score contribute to the final score.

## Terminology review (click to expand)

*Current status:* Current value relative to reference point.
*Likely future status:* Predicted status score five years in the future based on current status and three additional variables:
  
  - *Trend:* short term (usually 5 years) observed change in status 
  - *Pressures:* pressures acting on a goal to reduce its score, e.g., climate change, pollution, etc.
  - *Resilience:* ecological factors and social initiatives (policies, laws, etc.) that mitigate the pressures acting on a system
